# Autonomous-Ship
In Progress
# Project Goals
1. Learn how to autonomous a robot from start to finish
  - CAD
  - Embedded Systems/C++
  - Sensor Fusion - Kalman filter
  - Computer Vision
  - ROS
2. Ship should be 
able to navigate race course, think alpine/downhill skiing

# Accomplished Steps
1. Built boat 1.0 in Autodesk

2. Fused ultrasonic sensor with Raspberry Pi Camera to control angle of servo motor \
   a. Currently implementing autonomous following as the first use case


# Next Steps
1. Use SimScale and Autodesk Fusion built in tools to ensure boat is balanced with all components to avoid having to constantly 3D print boats
2. Use SG90 Servo Motor to control rudder 
3. Use Raspberry Pi with ultrasonic sensor and camera for sensor fusion and computer vision
